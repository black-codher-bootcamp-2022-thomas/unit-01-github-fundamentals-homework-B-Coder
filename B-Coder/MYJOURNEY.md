-- Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Steph aka B-Coder

-- What I've learned so far is how to clone a repository and download it on to my local machine and then change my directory in terminal. 

-- As I'm still new to coding I still second guess myself and as I'm unsure if I've done things correctly, but I coontinue to learn and am enjoying the challenge.
